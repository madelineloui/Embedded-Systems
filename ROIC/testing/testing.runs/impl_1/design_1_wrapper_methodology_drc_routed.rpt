XDCB-4#1 Warning
create_clock constraint set on both sides of diff pair port  
Two clock definitions sma_clk_P[0] and sma_clk_N[0] found on differential ports sma_clk_P[0] and sma_clk_N[0]. It is recommended to only create a clock on port P.
create_clock -period 66.667 [get_ports {sma_clk_P[0]}]
c:/Users/mloui/Documents/ROIC/testing/testing.srcs/sources_1/bd/design_1/ip/design_1_util_ds_buf_0_0/design_1_util_ds_buf_0_0.xdc (Line: 4)
create_clock -period 66.667 [get_ports {sma_clk_N[0]}]

Related violations: <none>

XDCC-1#1 Warning
Scoped Clock constraint overwritten with the same name  
A new clock constraint create_clock overrides a previous scoped clock constraint with the same name. It is not recommended to override a scoped (typically an IP) clock constraint and could result in unexpected behaviors.
New: create_clock -period 66.660 [get_ports sma_clk_P] (Source: C:/Users/mloui/Documents/ROIC/testing/testing.srcs/constrs_1/new/clk_design.xdc (Line: 14))

Related violations: <none>

XDCC-7#1 Warning
Scoped Clock constraint overwritten on the same source  
A new clock constraint create_clock overrides a previous scoped clock constraint defined on the same source. It is not recommended to override a scoped (typically an IP) clock constraint and could result in unexpected behaviors.
New: create_clock -period 66.660 [get_ports sma_clk_P] (Source: C:/Users/mloui/Documents/ROIC/testing/testing.srcs/constrs_1/new/clk_design.xdc (Line: 14))

Related violations: <none>

CLKC-21#1 Advisory
MMCME3 with ZHOLD does not drive sequential IO  
The MMCME3 cell design_1_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/mmcme3_adv_inst has COMPENSATION value ZHOLD, but CLKOUT0 output does not drive any sequential IO cells. It is recommended to use the MMCM without a feedback buffer and set COMPENSATION to INTERNAL.
Related violations: <none>
